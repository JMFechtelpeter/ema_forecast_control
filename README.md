## Status of This Code
 
This codebase is currently being prepared for public, reproducible release.  
At this stage, it is **not** intended to be run “out of the box” by external users.
 
In its current form:
 
- Several file paths and configuration settings still point to **internal servers and infrastructure** that are not accessible outside our institution.
- The scripts assume a **specific computing environment** (e.g., operating system, library versions, job scheduler, and file system layout) that is not documented here yet.
- Some components depend on **data that cannot be publicly shared** (e.g., due to privacy or licensing restrictions) and are therefore not included in this repository.
- The code has not yet been fully refactored or packaged into a user-friendly format (e.g., installation scripts, container images, or step-by-step workflows).
 
We are in the process of:
 
- Replacing internal paths with **portable configuration options**.
- Adding **documentation** (e.g., environment specification, dependency list, and usage instructions).
- Preparing **example data or synthetic data**, where appropriate, to demonstrate the main workflows.
- Ensuring that the codebase is suitable for **long-term public distribution** upon publication.

## Intended Use (Current Version)
 
At this revision stage, the repository is primarily intended to:
 
- Document the **exact codebase** used for the analyses in the manuscript.
- Enable **editorial and peer review** of the implementation details.
 
It is **not yet** intended as a ready-to-run software package for general use or for full reproduction of all results by external users.

## Planned Public Release
 
Subject to acceptance of the manuscript, we plan to:
 
1. Clean and refactor the code for public release.
2. Provide clear instructions on:
   - Required software and dependencies
   - How to configure paths and data locations
   - How to reproduce key analyses and figures (where data sharing is permitted)
3. Update this `README` with:
   - A detailed **installation** section
   - **Step-by-step usage** examples
   - Information on **data access** or synthetic data
 
Once this process is complete, we will update the repository and documentation accordingly.
